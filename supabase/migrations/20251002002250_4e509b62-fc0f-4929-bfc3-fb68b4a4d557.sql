-- Fix RLS policies for avatars bucket to allow authenticated users to upload their own avatars

-- Drop existing policies if any
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects;

-- Allow authenticated users to upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow authenticated users to update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow public access to view avatars (since bucket is public)
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
